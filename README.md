Time after time, here and there we all discover new features & possibilities
of Swift. One of it is right in front of you. But we think this particular
Swift feature is of worth being discovered by you.  
We hope that the process of solving this task will bring you a pleasure along,
of course, with the knowledge.


#### Task
* üõ† Fix the `func localizedString(` in a such way, that
`LocalizableStrings.label_text` & `LocalizableStrings.button_title`
will match test results
* ‚ö†Ô∏è Don't spoil the answer with the PR
* üìß Email a function (insights and comments are welcome)

#### Restriction
* You can change [only 2 lines (#15 & #16) in a `LocalizableStrings.swift`
file](CraftyChallange/LocalizableStrings.swift#L15-L16)

##### Hint
This is our most loved trick lately. Somebody even call it `dirty trick`. We
call it `the biggest expression of laziness ever`.
